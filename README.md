Hello!

This repository contains all the files related to the module Regression Models in the Data Science class at Coseup.
The Lesson on Regression Models aim to provide us with tools to understand and be able to build regression models using python.
I will be using an env.py containing my access code to connect to the Codeup database to access the necessary files.

I will be creating wrangling files to acquire and prepare the data, then modeling .ipynb files containing the model.

This README.me can be subject to changes as I go through the lesson.
